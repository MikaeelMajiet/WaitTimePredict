# WaitTimePredict
This is a Streamlit-powered web app that uses machine learning to predict patient wait times at clinics based on real-world variables like cancellations, staff count, weather, and more.
Predicts average wait time using a trained Random Forest or Linear Regression model.
- Interactive sliders and dropdowns for real-time scenario testing.
- Dynamic heatmap shows optimal appointment slots (green = low wait, red = high wait).
- Built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Plotly.
