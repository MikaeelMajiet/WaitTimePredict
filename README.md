**OVERVIEW**


WaitTimePredict is an interactive, AI-driven dashboard that predicts patient wait times at clinics based on dynamic inputs like staffing levels, walk-ins, and appointment data.

The tool is built using Streamlit and machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest), trained on real-world clinic data.


It helps healthcare administrators optimize appointment scheduling and staffing strategies to reduce patient waiting time and improve operational efficiency.


**FEATURES**


Real-time wait time predictions using ML models

Dynamic inputs via sliders and toggles (e.g., walk-ins, staff count, equipment downtime)

Interactive heatmap for identifying congestion vs. ideal booking times

Model switcher toggle (Linear Regression / Random Forest)

Visual feature importance from trained models

Ready for clinics across diverse urban/rural settings
